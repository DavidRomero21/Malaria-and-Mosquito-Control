<h1>Malaria and Mosquito Control</h1>

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Excel</b> 
- <b>C++</b>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Applying numerical methods to a mosquito population in order to determine which course of action should be taken to control the population.
</p>

<h2>Euler's Method:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>This was used to approximate solutions for the rate of drug decay and mosquito population changes over time. It provided insights into how drug levels diminish rapidly and how populations respond to control measures. 
In this scenario, the drug atovaquone is used to keep one safe from mosquitos.
</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Runge-Kutta:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>RK was similar to Euler's method. It provided greater accuracy than Euler's method, capturing non-linearities in growth rates and control effectiveness. This method also focused on comparing three methods to combat the mosquito population.</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Scenario A:</b> High insecticide effectiveness, significant immediate population reduction, but high ecological and monetary costs.</li>
    <li><b>Scenario B:</b> Moderate habitat reduction with minimal insecticide usage, slower population reduction but lower long-term risks.</li>
    <li><b>Scenario C:</b> Balanced approach with moderate insecticide and habitat control, ecologically friendly and cost-effective but slightly less effective in population reduction.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
